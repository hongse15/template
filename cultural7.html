			<h1>Conclusion</h1>
			<p>In conclusion, the movie “Frozen” has multiple conflicts that led sibling to have strong relationship with each other. Within the conflicts, the most eye catching conflict was that Elsa was treated like a monster for her ability. This conflict connects to our society’s social issue of discrimination on disabilities. The discrimination happens everywhere without people noticing it. This discrimination not only happens in certain community, but also all around the world. It has been passed down from generation to generation. The solutions that have been provided already have effect on our society. Solutions like Discrimination act or Organizations are beneficial to our society for disabilities to fit into the society. However, some of these solutions could be abusive through laws. The general point of view is that these laws and organizations are changing our society for everyone to be fair. </p>
