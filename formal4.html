			<h1>Interview</h1>
			<p>Economists signify the use of the statistics. The data that economists’ research are always</p><p>important to make their decision on writing their scholarly journals. These data’s are the fact based materials </p><p>so the result that economists have in mind could mostly be similar to others if they are able to predict the </p><p>right speculation (Ballard). However, the speculation will not always be same even if the past data are same. The </p><p>answer for the scholarly journal all depends on how well the each of the economist interprets the data. Also, </p><p>these economist’s speculations are not always true. The economy cannot be tested like science in order to predict </p><p>the answer. The result always varies every time and determines by each situation. Also, when economists’ write </p><p>their own assumption, they reference other economist’s journal and agrees or disagrees about their statement (Ballard).</p><p> For example, when Mr. Ballard (Charles Ballard - current Professor of economics in Michigan state </p><p>university and director of State of the State Survey) assumes that his colleagues’ opinion is not right, he would </p><p>include his colleagues name in this journal to state his opinion and include his own thoughts. The Mathematical </p><p>terms that economist use is important. In the interview with Charles Ballard, he stated that “There are a lot of </p><p>mathematical notations in the journals that we write. With the mathematical terms, we can simulate the economy. </p><p>In my master’s degree, I have used this simulation in the computer to find out the simulated economy. The formula </p><p>determined by increasing or decreasing many factors such as tax rate, unemployment rate or corporate tax.” The </p><p>other sources that economist use to find information is that they use is survey (Ballard). The surveys that </p><p>economists use depends the journal that they write. As mentioned before, survey also is a part of data use. In </p><p>Michigan, there is multiple survey research and some of the programs would be “State of the State survey” and </p><p>“Consumer sentimental index” (Ballard). They would use this information to calculate the mathematical formula for the </p><p>simulation of economy. After they have calculated these formulas, the economists state their own theory of their own topic. </p><p>

After Economists combine their research, they use these statistic, data, graphs, and scholarly journals to write their </p><p>own journal. As mentioned before, economist’s job is to interpret these sources from the past to analyze the </p><p>economy of future and since they are hard to be testified, most of the speculation has to be simulation. This is called </p><p>“Empirical study” (Hong). The main focus of this work is to assume the future based on the past data. </p><p>Economy involves every aspects of our society. It relates to every piece of our work and in order to study this </p><p>discipline, they need to have plenty of information to analyze their work. Even though they are categorized into </p><p>different areas such as political economy, scientific economy or economic liberalism, they are all related to one </p><p>purpose. It is to find out the specific details of each area and analyze them as compiled form of data. It mostly </p><p>involves the economic situation of that specific nation or the firms that they have researched on and include </p><p>their own assumption as a result. The each area also has to discuss the pros and cons of the information. (CareerPlanner.com).
