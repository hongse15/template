<h1>Retrospective Project</h1> 
<h2>Seungpyo Hong</h2> 
<p>From the beginning of this course, students went through many different topics of essays written as their project and all of their topics vary. Lived experience, Cultural analysis and formal research projects were all individual essay that has to be done on their own. Depending on the projects, the portions of writing types are different. Some project involve main on independent thinking, some requires significant research and other project has to be done as a group. </p>
<p>The start of this course was not the hardest task. As an international student, English was not my first language and for this reason, there was definitely a difficulty that had to be overcome by myself. The Lived experience project was one of the easy and simple tasks out of all the project. Writing about my own experience on choosing my major was interesting for me and by writing all the experience, I refreshed my memory to reconstruct the experiences that I had. From this project, it is very important to explain the certain event or episode to build the content of choosing major. The computer had definitely changed my way of choosing my major. For example, the computer was like a guidance that helped me and led me to choose General management in many different ways. The most important experience that I had with computer was the stock exchange experience through computer. When I first hear about the concept of stock market, it was confusing and did not understand the basic idea. I worked hard to understand the concept of the stock but the one method that helped me to understand this is stock market game in Investopedia. This game was done online and it is a game run by game money on this website. By buying and selling the money, I noticed that the prices were going up and down for every single company depending on people’s purchasing power. Even though this game was extra credit point for economic class, I have learned interesting fact about stock market and caught my attention to learn specifically about this field. Other than stock market, I was also flexible at using excel and power point. These allowed me to think that business area might be the place for me.</p>
<p>The second project that we worked was Cultural analysis project. This project involved mostly researching as our essay. The project consist the certain type of artifact that needs to be investigated and discuss the argument that has been connected to our society. Some of the artifacts like movie, or novels are connected directly or indirectly to our society’s social norms. The artifact that I choose was a movie called “Frozen”. The movie was about princess who has special power of freezing anything and when she was young, she was told that she could harm people around her with her power. She had to secret her power so that no one could know her as a sorcerer. However, when she became old and on her coronation, she accidently revealed her power and everyone treated her as a monster. Since this project is to connect to our social issue, I related with the disabilities. People who are disabled have hardship. Even though our society has gotten better, there are still people who are not treating these people the same way as normal people.  The society that I connected was puritan society. They also had idea that Witches were the ones who speak to people and control them to be disgraced by acting differently or if there is any affair between men and women. This action was called “Witchcraft”. When certain people were treated as witchcraft, they were usually treated as outsider just like disabled but hasher. People put them is in court to make a decision and as a result, they would be ostracized or hanged from certain society.  As a solution for this problem, I have found some of the organizations that could help disabilities to fit into our society. NOD (National Organization of disability) is an organization for these people to help them to settle and provide any help if necessary. Some of the Law like DDA (Disabled Discrimination Act) is a law to defend disabilities to be separated from our society. My concluded solution is that like these Laws and organizations, they have to be spread widely and these type of barricade has to be created more and more so that people have the norms that criticizing disabled is wrong.</p>  
<p>The next project was formal research project. The purpose of this project was to analyze and find the way that people in our major communicate with each other. This project requires us to interview people who are in the field and professor who study this discipline. This is also a researching task that each of the students has to search their own major. The major that I wrote about was economist. Some of the communication way that I have found was using Scholarly journals or articles. My first interview was done with my father who is an analyst in South Korea over 30years in the field. He stated that most of the economists use the articles to communicate with each other. The articles not only include just a news articles, but also the articles that other economist, reporter, or even politicians wrote. However, the sources and the communication would mostly be done with the articles that economist wrote. By using this information from articles, each economist states their ideas on each of their area. Some agree and some disagree with the articles statement. Others make their own theory to argue some of the topic. For example, when new product from Samsung is produced, there will be articles coming out in magazine or in news website. Economist will read them and write their own opinion about the cause and effect about this new phone’s release. This article will be out in the press as well and will be read by another economist to agree or disagree with the article. By cycles around, this forms a communication within economists. Another interview was done with Mr.Ballard from economy department. He is currently a professor of Michigan State University and a director of State of the State Survey. He stated that there are many different methods that he uses other than articles. First is to release the books that economist wrote about their theory and idea about certain topic. This work just like articles but more detailed. He also said using mathematical formulas would be another method. Even though not every economist fit into the formula that they have created, the economy will shape similarly with the formulas that they have formed.</p> 
<p>The last project was Remix project. This is completely a group project that needs every group member’s reliance. If some group members fail to cooperate the work, then it will be hard to complete perfect outcome. The task was to make a documentary video of our project to state the social issue. Our topic was about game addiction of teenagers and young adult. The game addiction is the most simple and important problem in our society that people has to consider changing. From the information that we have found on the news or articles, most of the teenagers were having problems for playing too much. The outcomes were non-stop playing, illusion and health issue. From these outcomes, the most important issue that teenagers had were not able to identify the real life and illusion. When these children play for long period of time, they tend to think that they could be just like a player in the game. In the worst case, this leads to a crime. For example, the crime that we have researched was about a 15year-old boy who tried to rob a bank with a fake gun. He was caught on sight and during the investigation; he stated that his actions were motivated from the game called Gand theft Auto. This game is a character committing crime to complete the quest so the crime involves robbing, shooting gun, fighting and even bombing. After we find information, we had to make this into a documentary film. We also gathered friends’ opinion about the game addiction to make it more documentary like. The first start was hard since I was not aware of the documentary filming style. I had to watch the films to see all the effect that documentary had and find it out. The Imovie was very good tool that we have used for our project.  Some of the effects were very effective thing to learn such as Ken burns effect. This is when picture zoom in or out slowly. The hardship and most important thing that I had to overcome was the teamwork. We had trouble contacting group members at the start which made it hard to put everything together. At the end, we eventually attached everything together.</p> 
<p>In conclusion, all of the projects were definitely challenging for me and depending on the project, it had its easy and hard parts about it. Not only it was challenging, but also I have learn something from all of the topics given as a project. From the lived experience, I refreshed my memories of making my decision on my major. Some of the inspiring moments gave a way to choose my major. From the formal research, it gave me conviction that Business would be the right path for me. However this learning may differ depending on people. These two projects were most important topics that I have learned but for other people, it could be other materials.</p>
