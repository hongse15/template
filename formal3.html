		<p>In order for economist are writing their own articles, they have to think about other side effects. There could be many factors that affect economic status. The Change in the price of Oil is very good example of this change of economy. About 1970s, the Oil shock gave huge impact in the world’s economy. During that time, the Middle East suddenly announced that they would stop selling oil for certain time and the price of oil sky rocketed for few month. Because of this shocking announcement, Korea also had to suffered significant transportation problem since people are not able to afford to buy the oil (Hong). The environmental differentiation could be one factor that decides the economic status (Hong). For example, the weather difference affects economic status. The rain fall could be effective if it leads to flood in certain area because it will destroy various supplies such as electricity, farming or people’s habitat. The droughts also have similar effect on the farming. Sine farming is yearly based business; the damage will go for the whole year. These hazards could be a curial change in the market in our economy. Other than weather, Natural disaster has significant effect on our economy. The earthquake, tornado, tsunami or volcanic eruption will lead to enormous damage in our society’s economy crash. The destruction and the recovery will be significant that loss of money will lead to market crash. Not just a natural disaster, there are other factors like market crash, war and invention of new technology that are able to affect our economy. A good example of Market crash would be Black Friday in 1929. These factors are general events that could lead to an economy change and other than these factors; there are many other possibilities that could determine the change of economy. Depending on all of these side effects, economists analyze the cause and damage and predict the economy. The predictions could be made for the amount of damage of the disasters. Economists have to research all of these probabilities to make their speculations. As an example, if the damage was sever but, the recovery could be made easily, the economist could include the information that the economy will get better soon. </p>

<p>Since there are varieties of effects, some economists turn to a different point of view (Hong). There are some companies that benefit from these natural disaster, War or market crash. For example, when natural disaster like earthquake occurs, the government has to get some sort of supply from the resource company. This is where they turn to inferior goods and purchase them. The ratio of supply and demand is always opposite when people’s income reduces the demand for the inferior good increases. As a result, companies that sell inferior goods earn a lot of money from this. Economists usually write their journal or book with the co-authors but, there are also economists who write their own journals of researches about these facts (Ballard). Based on these journals, there are people who are interest in buying the share of this firm because they know that the share of this inferior good company’s share will increase. Just like these circulation, economists exchange their information by publishing their writing including their image of economy. The NBER (National Bureau of Economic research) is one of the economist’s researching centers that allows to economist to make publication possible and has each topic area that they have specific work on. Just like conference, economists are organized to share their articles to talk about the economic situation they have research on (Hong).<p>
