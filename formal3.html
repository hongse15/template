		<p>In order for economist are writing their own articles, they have to think about other side effects.</p><p> There could be many factors that affect economic status. The Change in the price of Oil is very good example of </p><p>this change of economy. About 1970s, the Oil shock gave huge impact in the world’s economy. During that time, the </p><p>Middle East suddenly announced that they would stop selling oil for certain time and the price of oil sky </p><p>rocketed for few month. Because of this shocking announcement, Korea also had to suffered significant transportation </p><p>problem since people are not able to afford to buy the oil (Hong). The environmental differentiation could be one </p><p>factor that decides the economic status (Hong). For example, the weather difference affects economic status. The </p><p>rain fall could be effective if it leads to flood in certain area because it will destroy various supplies such </p><p>as electricity, farming or people’s habitat. The droughts also have similar effect on the farming. Sine farming </p><p>is yearly based business; the damage will go for the whole year. These hazards could be a curial change in the </p><p>market in our economy. Other than weather, Natural disaster has significant effect on our economy. The earthquake,</p><p> tornado, tsunami or volcanic eruption will lead to enormous damage in our society’s economy crash.</p><p> The destruction and the recovery will be significant that loss of money will lead to market crash. Not just a natural </p><p>disaster, there are other factors like market crash, war and invention of new technology that are able to affect our economy. </p><p>A good example of Market crash would be Black Friday in 1929. These factors are general events that </p><p>could lead to an economy change and other than these factors; there are many other possibilities that could </p><p>determine the change of economy. Depending on all of these side effects, economists analyze the cause and damage and </p><p>predict the economy. The predictions could be made for the amount of damage of the disasters. Economists have to </p><p>research all of these probabilities to make their speculations. As an example, if the damage was sever but, the </p><p>recovery could be made easily, the economist could include the information that the economy will get better soon. </p><p>

Since there are varieties of effects, some economists turn to a different point of view (Hong).</p><p> There are some companies that benefit from these natural disaster, War or market crash. For example, when natural disaster like </p><p>earthquake occurs, the government has to get some sort of supply from the resource company. This is where they turn to </p><p>inferior goods and purchase them. The ratio of supply and demand is always opposite when people’s income reduces </p><p>the demand for the inferior good increases. As a result, companies that sell inferior goods earn a lot of money </p><p>from this. Economists usually write their journal or book with the co-authors but, there are also economists who </p><p>write their own journals of researches about these facts (Ballard). Based on these journals, there are people who </p><p>are interest in buying the share of this firm because they know that the share of this inferior good company’s share will increase.</p><p> Just like these circulation, economists exchange their information by publishing their </p><p>writing including their image of economy. The NBER (National Bureau of Economic research) is one of the economist’s </p><p>researching centers that allows to economist to make publication possible and has each topic area that they have </p><p>specific work on. Just like conference, economists are organized to share their articles to talk about the </p><p>economic situation they have research on (Hong). </p><p>
