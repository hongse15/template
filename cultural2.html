			<h1>Introduction</h1>
			<p>Similarly to Elsa, people in the real world who have disabilities are treated the same way. For a long time, disabled or mental patients has been treated not the same way as a normal person. People always have negative point of view when they see a person who are unfamiliar to them. It is peopleâ€™s nature that they put space in between these people. People tend to treat them differently and insult these people for their appearance. This treatment has been occurring for more than centuries. In Spartan society, people who have disabilities were killed immediately after their birth or they were speculated before the council makes decision (Shafer). In the council, they make decision whether to kill them or keep them alive. The council made decision because these people were considered as a government property (Shafer). Other than disabilities and mental patients, the similar situation also happened in our history. Puritan society in Earlier American and European society accused many people as a witchcraft and murdered hundreds of people. When a specific person act differently than others or have bad relationship with others, people around community accused them as witchcraft. They usually made false confession that they saw this specific person speaking to devil or conspiring with devil. They had to make false confession to survive. Otherwise there were hanged. As a result, these people usually accuse other person for same witchcraft to survive on their own or they admit the witchcraft and ostracized from the community (Breslaw). These historical background gives us the information that people were treated differently just because of their physical appearance or their unusual action. Elsa had same treatment for using her power. </p>
