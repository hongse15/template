			<h1>Analysis of Artifact</h1>
			<p>The content of the story is that typical sibling relationship. Siblings have fun together but also they also had conflict. In the movie, conflict and resolution were expressed dramatically through gaining ability to make things normal. Anna and Elsa also had the similar type of sibling relationship except that Elsa had to be away from outside contact. Anna’s love towards Elsa was different since they didn’t have many chances to be with each other. Maybe this was also one of the reasons that they had strong feelings toward each other. All of this was possible because of the conflicts that made this sibling to have strong love between them. However, this was not the main problem. The society’s point of view towards abnormal person was very sensitive and harsh. Citizens in the story had conservative aspect and treated Elsa as a monster. She had nothing wrong but it was society’s point of view that made Elsa run away. This relates to our society’s discrimination that people treat disabled person not the same way that they treat normal person. </p>
