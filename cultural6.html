			<h1>Anticipated Effects</h1>
			<p>As a result of these solutions, the society is getting better. More and more organizations will be formed for these people and there are also students who help these people for their volunteering activity. In South Korea, middle school and high school students have certain times that they have to work voluntarily in order to fill their requirement. Some students work in senior citizens' centers to help elders who are physically unhealthy or go to residential facilities to help these disabilities. This not only gave opportunity to help these people, but also students learn how to treat these people in public. Their actions have changed significantly through these voluntarily working hours. Forming all of these skills brought benefits to our society that people changed their negative point of view on not just disabilities, but also people who are different than others. The society will get better since organizations work globally. Human Asia is one of the examples of this. This group also gives education for students who are interested in human rights and who want to help the minorities. They also provide internship for some of applicants to give opportunity to build their experience (Soh). On the other hand, there are also side effects of these solutions. There are multiple laws other than just DDA but, some disabilities use these laws to take advantage and extort money from other people. There are laws that protect discrimination in a work force just because of disability could also be lawsuit target. For example, the US government states that there is still discrimination happening in the work place. The discrimination about disabled not only includes the external look, but it also includes people who had cancer or mental issues (U.S equal employment opportunity commission). Even if these people become healthy again, discriminating for their past sickness is considered abusive statement and used in a court. However, these side effects rarely happened in our society. </p>
