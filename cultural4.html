			<h1>Description of Issue</h1>
			<p>Even though the treatment of disabled and Elsa is different, the big similarity is that both of these societies treat minorities not the same way as normal person. There are people who still treat disabilities differently compare to commoners. The way they look at these people are different. Just like in the past, their actions and appearances play big role for their depreciation. We can see similar problems occurring everywhere around the world. For example, there are disabled people walking around the city bagging for money, but there are no people who help them to settle in comfortable lives. The movie also contains similar situation as people treating disabilities.  In the movie, peoples’ reactions were mostly shocked and afraid of her when she first used her power. It was an accident but for the citizen’s point of view, they would have felt that they were being attacked. Some citizens thought the power was consider as a sorceries which was close to witchcraft. This is not the focus of the story but it is one of the main factors that Elsa had abandoned her city and castle. She was pressured and forced to get away from people around her community even if she did not want to.</p>
