			<h1>Introduction</h1> 
			<p>
				<p>The way that Economist writes information has many different methods. The first thing</p> <p>that economists do is reading and gathering scholarly journals or articles that other economist wrote. Other than</p> <p>just scholarly journals and articles, there are other sources that help them to obtain information. There is press</p> <p>conference made by the US government that announces the economic status about inflation & consumption rate, trade,</p> <p>unemployment rate and poverty percentage. After stating this information, they talk about what has to be done for the</p> <p>better future (Hong). It is also a place for the economist to state their speculation and discuss their prospective</p> <p>future economy. The conference is usually done in quarterly and when economist talks about the economy, they divide</p> <p>into four sections to separate the terms. Other than governments’ press conference, AEA (American Economic Association)</p> <p>is good example for economists to gain information (AEA). It is a conference for the economists to exchange</p> <p>information by making presentation about all the statics and economic status on the world. This organization’s purpose</p> <p>is to encourage the economic discipline as much as possible for the economist to engage in their discussion and share</p> <p>their information with others. It is good source for the economist because they not only are able to communicate with</p> <p>each other, but also they have the opportunity to build their professions by participating in the conference. There</p> <p>are multiple way that scholarly journal is used. For example, the topic of the scholarly journal about United</p> <p>Kingdom’s economy could use as a trade journal publication. In this trade publication “The UK Economy: Is the outlook</p> <p>really that good?”, the content states that economic status of United Kingdom is depended by the US economy (O'Carroll).</p> <p> The main idea is that even if the United Kingdom’s economy growth is increasing rate, the risk that they face is</p> <p>unavoidable and even if the United States is able to recover the economy, United Kingdom is unsure of their future</p> <p>speculation due to their slowly growing rate of unemployment and lower inflation. The other important fact is that the</p> <p>journal has to include the economists’ own speculation all time. This is the whole point of writing these journals.</p> <p>The image that each economist’s thought should be included in order to exchange information otherwise the paper that</p> <p>they wrote would only just an analyzed form of certain topic. So, after economist gathered information about the</p> <p>United Kingdom’s status, <p>economists predict the outcome of United Kingdom’s future.</p>
