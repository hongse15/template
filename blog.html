                <h1>Reflections on video 1 14/1/22</h1>
                <p> Most of the people have negative point of view on homosexual. People use it as a bad word and point finger at these people. The main problem came from the society's point of view. In the video, the man spoke out his thoughts about this path. He first talks about his life of homosexual and the sad ending of his past life. He blames the fact that Uncle Ronnie was the reason that he feels miserable and also the reason that he have changed. The man talks about this life as if it is repeating the same way that his uncle did. He is not shamed of choosing to like someone who has same sex. From this point of view there is nothing wrong about it but I asume it is the society that made him sad at the moment and made his uncle Ronnie disappointed. It is sad for me to watch the video. He didn't do anything wrong and had to be blamed for loving someone who has the same sex as him. The way that he has live his life could have feel disappointing and angry. Having normal family and normal life could be hard for him and his family as well. He also would have felt that he doesn't want to repeat his path the way that his uncle did.<p/> 
                
                <p>The main idea that people has to do is change the mind set about looking at homosexsuals. There are thousands of people who are afraid to telling their true identity. Internal conflict gives these people or students a stress and in worst case, leads the their suicide.

                <h1>Reflections on video 2 14/2/5</h1>
                <p>
Identifies the group of people targeted in the video<p/>
<p>-	People who plays games generally and people who focus too much on the games and has no life but playing the computer or video games. <p/>
<p>Explains the social issue at hand<p/>
<p>-	One of the player killed every play he meets and people starts to lose interests on playing World of WarCarft. The players much accept dual to fight but since this player kills everyone, people are angry and frustrated with the player. <p/>
<p>Identifies and critiques the video's creators' view on that social issue<p/>
<p>-	In my opinion, video creator would have thought of the same emotional feeling. It would be annoying if he gets killed in the computer game without doing anything and might lose interest playing games. No one wants to play game that they already know the answer to. The video might also indicate that don’t do things that other people don’t like. I thought of this because the undefeatable player eventually got killed at the end because everyone gathered up and attacked him at the same time. These players all the same feeling towards the player and that is why he was meant to be killed.

           <h1>Reflections on video 3 14/3/26</h1>     
           <p>The Detroit was seen as the city with the factory that makes all the products. Also, the city was first seen as dirty because of dirty work of factory.<p/> <p>However, as the car drove to inside the city. People were seen as luxury and by showing this high quality city; they are mentioning that the Chrysler is for the upper class that are worth of riding this car.</p> <p>The inclusion of song “Lose yourself” make the audience think that the product might be rusty but from this rusty place of Detroit, the high quality car is made for the people who are able to afford it.</p> <p>The Tagline of “Imported from Detroit emphasize that the Chrysler is a car made from the city that produces the high quality products.</p> <p> In the Voiceover of this ad explains the all new classic and luxury car for the people that deserve it. </p>
           
           <h1>Experience is MSU</h1>
           <p>The first winter of Michigan was very tough for me to handle. I have never had winter cold as Michigan. When came back to second semester of MSU, the snow was rough that I had to stay in my dorm about week. Even though it was rough weather, we also holiday of our own for few days. Other than cold weather, the spring looks great in Michigan. The campus was the most favorite part of Michigan State University. Compare to Korea, having experience in the facility of Michigan was valuable memory for me. I never big campus as big as Michigan State University. The Classes were hard for me to cooperate as well. Since English was my second language, I had trouble following the class and some of the instructions from the class were unfamiliar for me. I graduated from Korean Highschool and compare to MSU, it was tolally different place.</p>

  
        <h1>Lived</h1>
<p>This project requires us to write our experience on what kind of things affected our choice of choosing our major. I wrote about computer affecting our choice of my major. During my high school time, Stock market game through computer gave me an inspiration that business area is the place that I should and want to be. People buying and selling stocks to earn money looked fun to me. However, I also saw a side effect of this. Black Friday of Great Depression was one of the reasons. However, if I study this field, I think I will be confident to work is a safe way use stock market.  </p> 

        <h1>Cultural</h1> 
<p>This project involved mostly researching as our essay. The project consist the certain type of artifact that needs to be investigated and by discuss the argument that has been connected to our society. For this project, I wrote about movie “Frozen”. The content of the story is that typical sibling relationship. Siblings have fun together but also they also had conflict. In the movie, conflict and resolution were expressed dramatically through gaining ability to make things normal society. This organization’s purpose is to make disabled heir to the workplace. The connection that I have wrote was the Elsa was treated like a outsider which was related with the disabled in our society. They have done nothing wrong and had to be treated differently. </p>

        <h1>Social issue of our sociey</h1>
<p>In my Cultural artifact project, I hav included some of the connection that people know but don't really act in their life. Disabled are still treated as the outsider and to fix this problem, people has to work togethr to change this. Idea that I have provide was to forming more organization like NOD or law of DDA. They are the two main and most example that I want people to know and support these group as well. Spreading this idea will help people to change their mind set that disabled are not outsider. They are same on the inside.</p>

        <h1>Formal</h1>

<p>This project requires us to write a communication method that certain major used. Each major has their own method of making communication and for the economist; the main method that they use is by communicating through articles. When economist read the article, they write the opinion of their own. It could be agreement or disagreement about the topic. Some people make their own theory or economy. From the interview on Mr.Ballard, I have discovered that mathematical formula could also be the method that people could communicate with each other. The mathematical term that economist use has their own way of stating by formula of each economy of their own field. By using these economy, economist understand the terms. </p>

        <h1>Interview of my Father</h1>
<p>I Interview my father because he is my mentor and role model of my life. He always gave me support and helped me as much as possible and as detailed as possible. His work inspired me to choose my major. I have no clear dream that I'm dying to do. It is true that He gave me a way to choose my major by showing his work, his life as a economist. He taught me how to be a economist and what kind of things I have to do. For the last 5 years he have done this for me and now I'm slowly chaning my mind that he might gave me th right way to become business man.</p>

        <h1>Remix</h1>
<p>The remix was the most hardest thing That I have ever done as a project in this semester. I have to organize all the work for the project. The topic that we have started was the "Game Addiction". I was not very hard topic to do because some of the information was very simple and clear topic. I also had an experience with the game addiction and talking about my expeience was simple and information that I could use as this project. However, Organizing the team member was the hardest thing for me. only one person cope with the work and one person game me as work through online. Also, the only girl memeber never gave me a work that I have assign her.The result turn out to be reasonble but I was frustrate at the end. </p>

        <h1>Group Work-filming video</h1>
 <p>The most important thing that we had was for filming was the meeting each other. people were not able to be together as one and They said they were all business. Finding video was maily all my job. I had to watch the documentary to mange the filming style. The documentary style was hard for me to follow when I first started. It had multiple effect that needed to be done as naturally following documentary style. However, one of the group memeber was about to use Imovie as our tool to make project. This was the most effect tool that we have used to put everything together.</p>
 
        <h1>Retropective</h1>
<p>As a final project, our job was to summarize all the work that we have done so far. It was not a hard task as my opinion. I looked at ever single work that I have done and for that, I learn things that I'm not aware of. From this lesson, the most important thing that I have done was to clearing my major and what I should and want to do. I have researched all the things I have thought of and for that, Business could be my way as a future. It is important to realize what people want to do and what they can do. I think I have got the part of what I want to do for my future. Finding out the next part is my job to do from now on. </p>
       
        <h1>codeacedemy</h1>
<p>The codecedemy was hard for me. I thought I would be good at it because I have done this sort of work during my highschool time. However, what I have learn in Highschool was justa beginning of the work that I had to do. The html was very complicated then I thought and the CSS was very new things for me to do. After I have finished all the work, I learn something of this making website. I thinki I will be usful in my life. Codecedemy requires a lot of typing of code for the website. this was the most bothering thing that I had to overcome do finishe this project.</p>
        <h1>blog</h1>
<p>The blogging about all the eleement was simple and only had to write the important and key materials. When I started this, some of the materials that I wrote refreshed my mind about this class. lived experience was the most easy and simple task for me and Since I like talking about my own stroy, I was enjoying writing. The most complicated one would be formal research project becuse eventhough my father had told me about his job and the work that he was doing, some of the example of the information has to be done by myself. Also, the interview was confusing at first because I was not organized for misunderstanding the concept of the project. </p>
        <h1>Final opinon</h1>
<p>As a Final projct, the writing class gave me multiple learning starting from choosing my major and what I want to do as my future career. I was hard at first to work on my project and formal research was the thing that gave me hard time as well as clearing my dream. This project gave me clear image what it would be like as a business man. The were many things that I had to do other than just writing essay but after I finished these materials It was refreshing.</p>
