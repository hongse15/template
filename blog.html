                <h1>Reflections on video</h1>
                <p> Most of the people have negative point of view on homosexual. People use it as a bad word and point finger at these people. The main problem came from the society's point of view. In the video, the man spoke out his thoughts about this path. He first talks about his life of homosexual and the sad ending of his past life. He blames the fact that Uncle Ronnie was the reason that he feels miserable and also the reason that he have changed. The man talks about this life as if it is repeating the same way that his uncle did. He is not shamed of choosing to like someone who has same sex. From this point of view there is nothing wrong about it but I asume it is the society that made him sad at the moment and made his uncle Ronnie disappointed. It is sad for me to watch the video. He didn't do anything wrong and had to be blamed for loving someone who has the same sex as him. The way that he has live his life could have feel disappointing and angry. Having normal family and normal life could be hard for him and his family as well. He also would have felt that he doesn't want to repeat his path the way that his uncle did. 
                
                The main idea that people has to do is change the mind set about looking at homosexsuals. There are thousands of people who are afraid to tell their true identity. Internal conflict gives these people or students a stress and in worst case, leads the their suicide.
