                <h1>Reflections on video 13/1/22</h1>
                <p> Most of the people have negative point of view on homosexual. People use it as a bad word and point finger at these people. The main problem came from the society's point of view. In the video, the man spoke out his thoughts about this path. He first talks about his life of homosexual and the sad ending of his past life. He blames the fact that Uncle Ronnie was the reason that he feels miserable and also the reason that he have changed. The man talks about this life as if it is repeating the same way that his uncle did. He is not shamed of choosing to like someone who has same sex. From this point of view there is nothing wrong about it but I asume it is the society that made him sad at the moment and made his uncle Ronnie disappointed. It is sad for me to watch the video. He didn't do anything wrong and had to be blamed for loving someone who has the same sex as him. The way that he has live his life could have feel disappointing and angry. Having normal family and normal life could be hard for him and his family as well. He also would have felt that he doesn't want to repeat his path the way that his uncle did.<p/> 
                
                <p></p>The main idea that people has to do is change the mind set about looking at homosexsuals. There are thousands of people who are afraid to telling their true identity. Internal conflict gives these people or students a stress and in worst case, leads the their suicide.

                <p>
Identifies the group of people targeted in the video<p/>
<p>-	People who plays games generally and people who focus too much on the games and has no life but playing the computer or video games. <p/>
<p>Explains the social issue at hand<p/>
<p>-	One of the player killed every play he meets and people starts to lose interests on playing World of WarCarft. The players much accept dual to fight but since this player kills everyone, people are angry and frustrated with the player. <p/>
<p>Identifies and critiques the video's creators' view on that social issue<p/>
<p>-	In my opinion, video creator would have thought of the same emotional feeling. It would be annoying if he gets killed in the computer game without doing anything and might lose interest playing games. No one wants to play game that they already know the answer to. The video might also indicate that don’t do things that other people don’t like. I thought of this because the undefeatable player eventually got killed at the end because everyone gathered up and attacked him at the same time. These players all the same feeling towards the player and that is why he was meant to be killed.
