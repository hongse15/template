                <h1>Reflections on video 1 14/1/22</h1>
                <p> Most of the people have negative point of view on homosexual. People use it as a bad word and point finger at these people. The main problem came from the society's point of view. In the video, the man spoke out his thoughts about this path. He first talks about his life of homosexual and the sad ending of his past life. He blames the fact that Uncle Ronnie was the reason that he feels miserable and also the reason that he have changed. The man talks about this life as if it is repeating the same way that his uncle did. He is not shamed of choosing to like someone who has same sex. From this point of view there is nothing wrong about it but I asume it is the society that made him sad at the moment and made his uncle Ronnie disappointed. It is sad for me to watch the video. He didn't do anything wrong and had to be blamed for loving someone who has the same sex as him. The way that he has live his life could have feel disappointing and angry. Having normal family and normal life could be hard for him and his family as well. He also would have felt that he doesn't want to repeat his path the way that his uncle did.<p/> 
                
                <p>The main idea that people has to do is change the mind set about looking at homosexsuals. There are thousands of people who are afraid to telling their true identity. Internal conflict gives these people or students a stress and in worst case, leads the their suicide.

                <h1>Reflections on video 2 14/2/5</h1>
                <p>
Identifies the group of people targeted in the video<p/>
<p>People who plays games generally and people who focus too much on the games and has no life but playing the computer or video games.
<p>Explains the social issue at hand<p/>
<p>-	One of the player killed every play he meets and people starts to lose interests on playing World of WarCarft. The players much accept dual to fight but since this player kills everyone, people are angry and frustrated with the player. They attempt to gather to kill this player. So the kids keep playing to put their level up. The thing that they are most concerned is the fact that this player might find them before they can get their levels up. So the kids didn't even sleep and play so they can reach their goal. They never get out from the chair and eat around their table. At the end, they everntually defeats the player. <p/>
<p>Identifies and critiques the video's creators' view on that social issue<p/>
<p>-	In my opinion, video creator would have thought of the same emotional feeling. It would be annoying if he gets killed in the computer game without doing anything and might lose interest playing games. No one wants to play game that they already know the answer to. The video might also indicate that don’t do things that other people don’t like. I thought of this because the undefeatable player eventually got killed at the end because everyone gathered up and attacked him at the same time. These players all the same feeling towards the player and that is why he was meant to be killed.

           <h1>Reflections on video 3 14/3/26</h1>     
           <p>The Detroit was seen as the city with the factory that makes all the products. Also, the city was first seen as dirty because of dirty work of factory.<p/> <p>However, as the car drove to inside the city. People were seen as luxury and by showing this high quality city; they are mentioning that the Chrysler is for the upper class that are worth of riding this car.</p> <p>The inclusion of song “Lose yourself” make the audience think that the product might be rusty but from this rusty place of Detroit, the high quality car is made for the people who are able to afford it. they image that could also be seen as showing the daarkside of the detroit. The most important thing that people see is the first imporession of everthing. This not only incuded a person, but also any materials. This is why the documentary that we have seen has the image of the two sides. One is the luxury side and the other darkside of detroit.</p> <p>The Tagline of “Imported from Detroit emphasize that the Chrysler is a car made from the city that produces the high quality products. this image of production is made in order to give the audience that this car is not a simple car that common people rive around. </p> <p> In the Voiceover of this ad explains the all new classic and luxury car for the people that deserve it. The owner of the car is the person has the ability to own money and drive around. </p>
           
           <h1>Experience is MSU</h1>
           <p>The first winter of Michigan was very tough for me to handle. I have never had winter cold as Michigan. When came back to second semester of MSU, the snow was rough that I had to stay in my dorm about week. Even though it was rough weather, we also holiday of our own for few days. The snow had the most influence of my experience in MSU life. Depending on people’s taste of their weather, some like winter and some like summer. I’m the one who think that summer is the best place for people to live so for me, MSU winter life was like nightmare to me. Other than cold weather, the spring looks great in Michigan. The campus was the most favorite part of Michigan State University. Compare to Korea, having experience in the facility of Michigan was valuable memory for me. I never big campus as big as Michigan State University. The Classes were hard for me to cooperate as well. Since English was my second language, I had trouble following the class and some of the instructions from the class were unfamiliar for me. I graduated from Korean Highschool and compare to MSU, it was totally different place. I also have an experience in Australia. The life style that I have in Australia has much difference from the Korea so I had trouble fitting into Australian society. Asian people are very sensitive on their food because they have been eating their own kind of food for long time. Such as this problem, I also had trouble not just in Australia, but also in USA.</p>

  
        <h1>Lived</h1>
<p>This project requires us to write our experience on what kind of things affected our choice of choosing our major. I wrote about computer affecting our choice of my major. During my high school time, Stock market game through computer gave me an inspiration that business area is the place that I should and want to be. People buying and selling stocks to earn money looked fun to me. The moment that I choose this was during my economics class where I was asked to finish the extra credit. The start was not very interesting. It was bothering work because we had to check every single stock that we buy and sell. Also, We were playing in American time zone so we had to buy and sell it during mid-night. Some students were not even sleeping to get extra credit. When I first started I didn’t understand it but as I pay more attention to the stock knowledge, I started to get excited. I worked all night just like other students. I was all because of computer that introduced this Investopedia game. Even though It was just a game, it gave me idea that this could be fun to work as my job. However, I also saw a side effect of this. People focus too much so that there are happenings like Black Friday of Great Depression. If I study this field, I think I will be confident to work is a safe way use stock market even though it could be hard and complicated. </p> 

        <h1>Cultural</h1> 
<p>This project involved mostly researching as our essay. The project consist the certain type of artifact that needs to be investigated and by discuss the argument that has been connected to our society. For this project, I wrote about movie “Frozen”. The content of the story is that typical sibling relationship. Siblings have fun together but also they have conflict that made all the tragedy in the story. In the movie, conflict and resolution were expressed dramatically through gaining ability to make things normal society. Elsa realized her power when she was very young by hurting her sister. It was an accident but she knew that it can’t uncontrollable. When her power was discovered, she was making everything freeze and gave the ice age for the community in the story. This organization’s purpose is to make disabled heir to the workplace. The connection that I have wrote was the Elsa was treated like an outsider which was related with the disabled in our society. They have done nothing wrong and had to be treated differently. The example that I have came up with was Puritan society. This society had the idea of witch craft because of some crazy action, disability and even having affair. When a person is accused of witchcraft. They are sometimes ostracized but mostly hanged for clans their sins that they have caused to others. It was right idea for the puritan society. However, the treatment that they had was not mature enough so that is it happened and I think this is similar idea where people don’t understand disabilities true identity.   </p>

        <h1>Social issue of our sociey</h1>
<p>In my Cultural artifact project, I have included some of the connection that people know but don't really act in their life. Disabled are still treated as the outsider and to fix this problem, people have to work together to change this. Idea that I have provided was to forming more organization like NOD or law of DDA. NOD(National Organization of Disability) is a organization that protects the disabilities from and danger and their rights. They also help these people to fit into the society that normal people are in and also teach them to be in the community. This organization has been spreading mostly in United States. These oragization has to be created more and this is our main theme. The Law DDA(Disability Discrimination act) is also law to protect from disability to be treated equally and the punishment is much harsher than the normal crime. This is why these laws and organization has to be created more. Even though this organization’s purpose is little different, HumanAsia is a organization that help poor to live well and claim the rights of minority in other country. This organization works similarly as DDA and NOD for claiming the rights of minority like poors and different race.  They are the two main and most example are the purpose choosing this topic. From this, I want people to know and support these groups as well. Spreading this idea will help people to change their mind set that disabled are not outsider. They are same on the inside.</p>

        <h1>Formal</h1>

<p>This project requires us to write a communication method that certain major used. Each major has their own method of making communication and for the economist; the main method that they use is by communicating through articles. When economist read the article, they write the opinion of their own. It could be agreement or disagreement about the topic. Some people make their own theory or economy. The articles that are all related with the topic are collected by the economist to do this. Economists realize and have to think about even aspect that affects the economy of their own topic to find their solution. In order to do so, article is the key to gain information. From the interview on Mr.Ballard, I have discovered that mathematical formula could also be the method that people could communicate with each other. The mathematical term that economist use has their own way of stating by formula of each economy of their own field. By using these economies, economist understands the terms that have been listed in mathematical formula and sometimes discuss about the ideas. The book could also be a communication system used just like articles. In the book, there are many different materials depending on what the topic is about. However, the communication method of stating each economist’s idea is all the same for every method. In my opinions, it is really hard to speculate the future economy because of many different factor such as natural hazard or dramatic change in the price of certain materials. But One way that could be possible is by communicating with people in their field. </p>

        <h1>Interview of my Father</h1>
<p>I interviewed my father for my formal research project because he is my mentor and role model of my life. He always gave me support and helped me as much as possible and as detailed as possible. His work inspired me to choose my major. I have no clear dream that I'm dying to do. It is true that He gave me a way to choose my major by showing his work, his life as an economist. When I was young, he used to take me to his office to show his working facility. I always watched him working. I started to get interested in the business field because of stock market game. Since I didn’t know well, He taught me to understand the concept. He also taught me how to be an economist and what kind of things I have to do to become like him. For the last 5 years he have done this for me and now I'm slowly changing my mind that he might gave me the right way to become business man. I know it because of the effort that I can realize just by looking at him. For choosing my major as an economist, it might be right or it might be wrong. But the only thing I’m sure is that he has faith in me that I can do well in this field even though he yells at me saying that you have a lot of things to do. He always encourage me when I’m sad and so that I can stand up again.</p>

        <h1>Remix</h1>
<p>The remix was the hardest thing that I have ever done as a project in this semester. I have to organize all the work for the project. The topic that we have started was the "Game Addiction". I was not very hard topic to do because some of the information was very simple and clear topic. I also had an experience with the game addiction and talking about my experience was simple and information that I could use as this project. When we were interviewing the students, they also had the similar idea that Game addiction is causing significant problem. The reason we have pick this topic is that it is very serious for some teenager and even young adults. Some of symptom that we have researched was that the health issue was very common for the students and illusion was the worst case. The young teenage boy in Liverpool actually robs the bank with the fake gun and this is was all because of the game Grand Theft Auto. Since this is causing serious problem, we wanted people to know that game addiction has to be dealt some way. However, organizing the team member was the hardest thing for me. Only one person cope with the work and one person game me as work through online. Also, the only girl member never gave me a work that I have assigned her. The results turn out to be reasonable but I was frustrated at the end. But at the end the project was completed as reasonable aspect. </p>

        <h1>Group Work-filming video</h1>
 <p>The most important thing that we had was for filming was the meeting each other. People were not able to be together as one and they said they were all business. Finding video was mainly all my job. I had to watch the documentary to manage the filming style. It was easy watching some of the documentary that other people have posted and by watching the videos, I have learn a lot of effect that has been shown in the documentary. The documentary style was hard for me to follow when I first started. It had multiple effects that needed to be done as naturally following documentary style. For example, effects like ken burns effect is the zooming in and out affect and used widely around the documentary field. It is usually done slow so that it has its meaning and well following looks. Also the effects of turning into other scene were my favorite part of the effect. Without this part, the documentary would not be good as it would be now. The hard part about this project was that not our entire group member participated the project. It was lucky that one of the group member was about to use Imovie as our tool to make project. This was the most effect tool that we have used to put everything together. Without his Imovie, We were not able to put everything together. We all worked separately at first because we didn’t have contact number at first. At the end, we met was able to finish it better than we thought. </p>
 
        <h1>Retropective</h1>
<p>As a final project, our job was to summarize all the work that we have done so far. It was not a hard task as my opinion. I looked at ever single work that I have done and for that, I learn things that I'm not aware of. There were some projects that were harder to me and some were easier for me.  Lived experience was very memorable for me. When I was writing about my choice of my major, I thought this is the one that I should do it. Stock market caught my attention that was very fun and I imagined becoming stock market manager. Also as in formal research project, I know that my father is the one who gave to hope to go to the path of business. From this lesson, the most important thing that I have done was to clearing my major and what I should and want to do. I have researched all the things I have thought of and Business could be my way as a future. It is important to realize what people want to do and what they can do.  There are people who do not have the future that they have dreamed of just like me. For some people, it’s very hard to do that. There are a lot of people say that university is the place to know what you want to do for your future. For me, I think I have got the part of what I want to do for my future. Finding out the next part is my job to do from now on.</p>
       
        <h1>codeacedemy</h1>
<p>The codecedemy was hard for me. I thought I would be good at it because I have done this sort of work during my highschool time. The computer class was my hardest class and because of this, I thought I never would have thought of taking class that has as coding. Even if I hated, I was very used to the coding at the end of the year. However, what I have learned in Highschool was just a beginning of the work that I had to do. The html was very complicated then I thought and the CSS was very new things for me to do. Even though I hated doing it, I kept on learning something and I was able to handle some of the problem and this made me surprise. I have worked for more than 2 weeks to learn step by step and even though it was hard, I tried my best to figure it out by myself. After I have finished all the work, I learn something of this making website. I think it will be useful in my life. Some of the code was very useful in this course and after I have learned it, I was able to teach my friends how to do it.  Codecedemy requires a lot of typing of code for the website and if I make one little mistake, I know that I can mass up the whole thing. This was the most bothering thing that I had to overcome do finish this project.</p>
        <h1>blog</h1>
<p>The blogging about all the eleement was simple and only had to write the important and key materials. When I started this, some of the materials that I wrote refreshed my mind about this class. lived experience was the most easy and simple task for me and Since I like talking about my own stroy, I was enjoying writing. The most complicated one would be formal research project becuse eventhough my father had told me about his job and the work that he was doing, some of the example of the information has to be done by myself. Also, the interview was confusing at first because I was not organized for misunderstanding the concept of the project. </p>
        <h1>Final opinon</h1>
<p>As a Final projct, the writing class gave me multiple learning starting from choosing my major and what I want to do as my future career. I was hard at first to work on my project and formal research was the thing that gave me hard time as well as clearing my dream. This project gave me clear image what it would be like as a business man. The were many things that I had to do other than just writing essay but after I finished these materials It was refreshing.</p>
