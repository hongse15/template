			<p>The scholarly journal is the key way that economists communicate with each other.</p><p> The way that economist use this scholarly journal is that they find each scholarly journal’s benefits and key information.</p><p> The information that they contain in the scholarly journals are different depending on how much they have used </p><p>information or their thoughts. Some of the scholarly journal could mainly contain the information of the fact </p><p>based materials. However, the scholarly journals that economist write usually involve the information and their assumption.</p><p> For example, when Motorola and Google had huge merger, there were significant scholarly journals </p><p>about the information of the pricing and the outcome of this merger. In the article of “Tech M&A: Google Buys </p><p>Motorola, Time Warner Moves Into the Midwest, HP Buys Autonomy”, it states the specific information of the merger. The </p><p>merger price was 12.5 billion dollar worth and CEO of Google stated that the Motorola will run its service by </p><p>android. However, Motorola will be running as a separate business (Thompson). As this information appeared to </p><p>economists, they gathered multiple scholarly journals about Google’s merger and think of the outcome of this M&A. The </p><p>scholarly journals that they write would be a communication method to exchange information within economists. </p><p>Another kind of method would be writing the analysis of the economic status of that specific firm. Economists have </p><p>to research specific area and write their speculation about the later effect of the economic status. In the </p><p>scholarly journal “The Knowledge Economy and Innovation: Certain uncertainty and the risk economy”, it states that </p><p>the relationship between the Innovation policy and National systems by connecting with the risk of the economy. </p><p>There are multiple risk economy mentioned in the scholarly journal and explain each of the concept specifically (Bullena).</p><p> Since the Risk economy affects the investment rate depending on the exchange rates, government </p><p>regulation, or political stability, the scholarly journal finally states that the decision should not be made urgently. </p><p>This information can be used efficiently by the economist to write their own scholarly journals and since these </p><p>scholarly journals are written by many different people, its part of exchanging information and communicating with others. </p><p>

When reading the scholarly journal or articles, economists have to find key factor of the whole context. </p><p></p><p>In order to do so, they need to be aware of all the contents to analyze the terms. There are multiple ways of finding information.</p><p> Sometimes it is hard for them to read every single detail so they look for key words of each context. </p><p>Similar to writing style, reading the referenced statement of other economist’s journal could not only be good </p><p>way to hear about other economist’s statement, but also discuss about it and share each others’ information. With </p><p>the information that has been gathered, the theory is made as mentioned in the previous paragraphs. For example, </p><p>when new technology is invented, there will always be cause and effect. When Samsung releases their new product, </p><p>there will be articles and scholarly journals about this product. The articles and scholarly journal could </p><p>contain information like “The released product was popular in Korea and the stock went up few percent just in one day”. </p><p>The economist would read this information to predict their thoughts on the cause.
