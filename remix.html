		REMIX PROJECT ASSESSMENT MEMO

<p>Re:  My memo of Multimedia Remix Project </p>
<p>The project that we choose motivated from the cultural artifact essay that Chris wrote. The content dealt with the story of game addiction that young teenagers were facing. The Issue that we chose was very common problem that young age group was facing. As I was founding more information about the game addiction, I had to support the fact about spreading how bad the game addiction is to teenagers and young adults.  The news story and the reactions of teenagers were shocking to be because this is the first time I realized the seriousness of the game addiction. When we were working on our group, we had trouble organizing group members at first and putting all the information even though group members had everything done on their own. At the end, we met and gathered everything together.</p>
<p>For selecting our issue, we talked about our projects that each of us had done so far but most attractive and most common issues was the game addiction. We though giving ideas about the seriousness of game addiction to the audience would be a good idea to do it. From this project, it was hard for me to set out into documentary video. When I was audience, the documentary was just normal television show that is around the channel. However, when we are given a task to make it, I had to look up the entire documentary to see the lay outs and setting to finish the video. I planned things out for each of the sections and explained every detail to my group members and I also took group members advice to make everything look better.</p>
<p>The general resource was web search to find the information. It was most effect because there were a lot of information on the game addiction and the side effects of it. We also used Youtube to find out some of the reactions, trailers of game and music for the background.</p>
<p>At first, I was not able to gather all the group members to work. I found it hard because I didn’t have their contact numbers to start with. After I found their contact, we talked about our project and I planned things to work for our documentary. The group members gave some mistakes and they helped me organize the work. With one my group member’s full support on editing, the final product was satisfied but I was not happy with some of the group member. There were three of our group members who have researched and finished most of the project. Other people ignored some of the messages and only have done few of the research. Other than this problem, we all had worked hard and gathered good final product. 
I was able to find the documentary style I need from Youtube experimented some of the style to use it in our video. So we used effect that original documentary consisted. The group members also gave me a support on the effect that I didn’t know of which worked out great and smooth. If this project were to be repeated, I would have contacted some of the professor who are working on these kinds of issues and interview their opinion. This way we could gain more scientific and more detailed information from these professors. </p>
<p>The most important fact about our project is giving detailed information on the game addiction. Our main theme is that people have to realize the seriousness of the game addiction and people need to give help to the ones who are suffering for these problems. There are few who could survive themselves from the game addiction and other who is addicted has mental issues and health issues. The crime in the Liverpool shows how serious the game could turn person and harm innocent citizens. I watched the documentary and organized the styles that they inquire to set things out. After I have organized the style, group members gave me a feed back for some of the style and we were able to finish the project. </p>
