			<h1>Proposed Solution</h1>
			<p>As a solution for this social issue there has to be more programs that help these disabilities and mental patients to fit in to the society and help them to get better. In order to do so, there should be volunteers who help these people to teach and support. This start must be initiated starting from school. It is easier for elementary students to make fun of another. They don’t realize how bad it is to these minorities. Students need to know how bad it is to discriminate the minorities and instead of discriminating them, they need to learn how to accept them as part of our social group and treat them fairly. The NOD (National Organization on Disabilities) is a good example of non-profit organization that helps these people to fit in to the society. This organization’s purpose is to make disabled hire to the workplace. They research by going through some of the work place to find the issue then find out the best way to get these people to be employed (Glazer). This organization works with school and military as a partnership to reach their goal. Also, learning about disabled is good way to approach them. When people know about disabled, they would understand their discomfort and possibly assist more than before. The funding is another good way to help these people to provide facilities and recruit people to help teaching. Human Asia is another example of organization that deals with the rights of human and find out the best way to retain their rights. They run mostly by gathering funding and donations. Its aim is mostly on poor people rather than disabled however, the purpose is same where they support the minorities. The organization sometimes travel around the Asian countries to find the region that lack in human support and fundraise for poor communities either library or health center (Soh). These kinds of organizations are the key to cure the discrimination of the minorities and make them fit into the society. Another solution would be forming multiple laws to protect these people. Since the discrimination is happening all over the places, there has to be laws that help disabled to be fit in to the society. Disabled Discrimination Act (DDA) is British law declared in 1995. It is very good example to support the idea that they are eligible to be treated same and have right to use same public uses without discrimination. Some of examples would be purchasing without price discrimination, having access to public facilities without limitation and same insurance (United Kingdom gov). Other than DDA, there has to be more organizations to help them not just to stop discrimination in work place, but also around communities and neighbors. Also, in order to protect disabled people as much as possible, these organizations and Laws have to be declared all around the world since some of these laws are not stated in some countries. </p>
