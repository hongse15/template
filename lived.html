Lived Experiences Project


	Over that past few decades, technology has changed our lives dramatically especially on electronic devices. People rely on electronic devices more and more as time went by. Now, it is impossible for people to live without it. Even at work, people use all sorts of electronic devices such as computer, tablet PC or Cellular phone. These are all the devices to help them work while they are in their office. In my perspective, electronic device not only helps our lives, but also gives us inspiration to decide people’s career path. These are the most important factors that impacted my life and reason for me to choose my major. 


	My major is General management. My main goal is to work in a finance company that deals with stock and bond. One of the company that I wish to work is J.P. Morgan. It is one of the blue chip Company of American Economy and highest paying company in the World. Working as a Stock manager has been my dream for more than 10 years. All of this was possible because of the computer. When I was 11 years old, I went to my father’s office. It was not planned but I found my dad in an office working on a computer investigating stocks through computers. He usually used computer to buy and sell stocks and bonds. Since his job was closer to analyzing, he usually made portfolio of each company to help him and his teammates to decide what to do. He was glad to explain each process of his work to me. He not only used computers to buy and sell, he also used it to speculate the companies’ economic status. It inspired me how he investigate each of the companies’ economic status even though I didn’t understand it. Since his analyzing dealt with stock investigation, I asked him about stock a lot because I didn’t understand how it worked. I also asked my dad about what do I have to do to work in finance company. From this question, there were multiple answers every time but, the most important answer was investigation. There has to be important factors to decide to buy the stock. However, most of these explanations were all related to using computers. The company’s economic status were all shown in a chart that changes every minute on computers and workers had to check information of company instantly for speculation. This can be done rapidly through computers. 


	When I was in 7th grade, I went to Australia to study. It was very hard for me to stay alone away from my parents. The homework and assignments were very hard for me to handle because it was my first time studying overseas. I didn’t have good academic grades even though I tried my best. However, there are two things I have learned a lot. First, Ability to use excel was very hard because there were some symbols that allows the user to calculate the data. When we were researching, or writing reports, calculation in excel helped us to complete the work faster than calculating every single research. For example, in a science report, I had to measure the length of bean sprouts each class I had and calculate the average of total growth as well as class average of total growth. It would have taken a long time but after learning excel, I could just put in few formulas and get the answer. Also, it was good to print out clean chart of report. The Power Point presentation was very important part of my use of computers. There are multiple ways to use computers to present a presentation project such as Prezi, Dropbox, blogging or web poster. Before I learnt it, I usually had posters drawn and presented it. It was not well done due to my lack of drawing skills. However, Power point is the simplest and most fascinating program that I have learned while I was studying in Australia. Prezi is sometimes hard to use it since the link changes and zooming in and out function confuses people. In Power point, the simple slides and animations allow me to present simply and clearly. It is also very easy to use it when internet is not available. These are the factors that computers helped me to choose my major as management. My father told me that ability to read and make charts makes easy for business man to read and understand fast on investigation of the company. Power Point Presentation is also another important part that shows how well the investigation had been done. Since I was comfortable using both, I thought I was able to do well on my major because combining these two skills might be helpful in the future of Business studies.


	After my study in Australia, I came back to Korea in International school to apply in American University. On my final year in international school, I finally had economics class. It was interesting class since I was fascinated about Economics. From this class, the most important experience I had was stock exchanging game in Investopedia. Even though it was very short period of time, I had experience of buying and selling stocks as economics assignment. The assignment went half of semester and usually used computers to operate the game. By using computers, I was able to read the News headlines of each stock I had and trade them at the same time. During this assignment, I finally had chance to use excel to finish my report. The way I used excel is calculating the amounts I have used as well as the amounts that I have gained and lost. It was harder than before but since I was familiar with working in excel, I finished my task faster than my classmates. It was an unforgettable experience because my father told me that speculation can not only be done by looking at the chart of a companies’ economic status. I have to see the inner story of the company. For example, when we look at Google’s stock, just by looking at the chart of Google does not tell us if the price will go up or down. So, opening up multiple web pages and reading all the news articles about all the company helped us to make our decision. What my father does is that he looks at the news very fast through Ipad, phone or computer and buys or sells stocks immediately. However, Ipad and Cellular phone sometimes does not clear the page due to its limited speed of memory chip. Also, opening multiple webpage sometimes slows down the devices. To have a secure line, my father mostly uses computers to operate his work. This is the good side of computers. Computers contain many different programs for people to dispose work in a short period of time. 


	In conclusion, there are various factors that may impact peoples’ live to choose their major. It all depends on what people do in their life. The most important moment that I had was watching my father working in his office was the true inspirational moment. Ever since then, I decided to study Business. However, this inspirational moment was not the only factors that lead me to choose Management. Learning about computers and all the techniques to become a business student was hard process before I went to study aboard to Australia. After I hold on to my temptation of hang out and tried my hardest to learn how to use computers, I become a management major. At the end I succeed to have all of these abilities and I was able to apply to Michigan State University.
